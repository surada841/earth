                The Earth is a complex, dynamic planet composed of several distinct layers, each with unique chemical,
                physical, and mechanical properties. These layers—crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core—are the
                result of planetary differentiation, a process that began during Earth’s formation about 4.5 billion
                years ago. The boundaries between layers were first deduced through the study of seismic waves generated
                by earthquakes, which change speed and direction as they pass through materials of different densities
                and states.1. The Crust: Earth’s Outermost Shell
                The crust is the thinnest and outermost layer, ranging from about 5 km beneath the oceans to 70 km under
                some mountain ranges. It is composed of solid rock, primarily granite (continental crust) and basalt
                (oceanic crust). The crust makes up less than 1% of Earth’s mass and contains relatively light elements
                such as silicon, oxygen, and aluminum.A. Continental CrustThickness: 20–70 km.
                Composition: Mostly granite (felsic), rich in silicon and aluminum (sial).
                Density: Lower than oceanic crust, allowing it to “float” higher on the underlying mantle.
                Age: Up to 4.4 billion years in some places; generally much older than oceanic crust.
                Structure: Heterogeneous, containing igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks.B. Oceanic
                CrustThickness: 5–10 km.
                Composition: Mostly basalt (mafic), rich in iron and magnesium (sima).
                Density: Higher than continental crust, causing it to subduct beneath continental plates at convergent
                boundaries.
                Age: Typically less than 200 million years due to continuous recycling at subduction zones.
                C. The Mohorovičić Discontinuity (Moho)
                The boundary between the crust and the mantle is marked by the Moho, a sudden increase in seismic wave
                velocity due to a change in rock density. Above the Moho, waves travel at speeds typical for basalt;
                below, they match those in peridotite or dunite, rocks of the upper mantle.
                2. The Mantle: Earth’s Thickest Layer
                The mantle lies beneath the crust and extends to a depth of about 2,900 km, making up about 84% of
                Earth’s volume and 68% of its mass. It is composed mainly of silicate minerals rich in magnesium and
                iron. The mantle is not uniform; it has several subdivisions based on mechanical behavior and chemical
                composition.
                A. Upper Mantle
                Lithosphere: The rigid, outermost part of the mantle, fused with the crust to form Earth’s tectonic
                plates. It is about 100 km thick and behaves as a single, brittle layer.
                Asthenosphere: Beneath the lithosphere, the upper mantle becomes the asthenosphere, a partially molten,
                ductile zone where rocks deform plastically and flow slowly over geologic time. This plasticity allows
                tectonic plates to move.
                Composition: Dominated by peridotite, a dense, ultramafic rock.
                B. Lower Mantle
                Depth: Extends from about 660 km to 2,900 km.
                State: Solid, but capable of very slow convective motion due to high pressure and temperature.
                Composition: More uniform than the upper mantle, with higher proportions of iron and magnesium
                silicates.
                3. The Core: Earth’s Metallic Heart
                The core is divided into the outer core (liquid) and inner core (solid), both composed primarily of iron
                and nickel. The core accounts for about 31% of Earth’s mass.
                A. Outer Core
                Depth: 2,900 km to 5,150 km.
                State: Liquid, due to extreme heat (4,000–6,000°C), despite immense pressure.
                Role: The convection currents in the liquid outer core generate Earth’s magnetic field through the
                geodynamo effect, which protects life from harmful solar radiation.
                Seismic Evidence: S-waves (shear waves) cannot travel through the outer core because it is liquid,
                providing key evidence for its state.
                B. Inner Core
                Depth: Below 5,150 km to Earth’s center (about 6,371 km).
                State: Solid, despite even higher temperatures, due to the crushing pressure of overlying material.

                Composition: Predominantly iron, with some nickel and lighter elements.

                Discovery: Detected in 1936 by seismologist Inge Lehmann, based on the behavior of seismic waves.
                4. Mechanical vs. Chemical Layers
                Earth’s layers can be defined both chemically (by composition) and mechanically (by physical
                behavior):Chemical Layers Mechanical LayersCrust Lithosphere (rigid)Mantle Asthenosphere (ductile)Outer
                Core Mesosphere (lower mantle, solid but convecting)InnerCore Inner Core (solid)
                The lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost, rigid part of the mantle, broken into tectonic
                plates that “float” on the ductile asthenosphere below. The asthenosphere’s plasticity enables plate
                tectonics, driving earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain-building.

                Most of our knowledge about Earth’s interior comes from seismology—the study of seismic waves generated
                by earthquakes. Different layers have distinct effects on these waves:
                P-waves (primary, compressional) can travel through solids and liquids, slowing down in the outer core
                and refracting at the core-mantle boundary.
                S-waves (secondary, shear) cannot travel through liquids, so their absence in the outer core confirms
                its liquid state.
                Reflections and refractions of seismic waves at layer boundaries (like the Moho, core-mantle boundary)
                reveal the depths and properties of these layers.
                Additionally, laboratory experiments on rock behavior at high pressures and temperatures, geochemical
                analyses of volcanic rocks, and gravity measurements provide supplementary evidence for Earth’s internal
                structure.
                6. The Earth System: Interacting Spheres
                Beyond its internal layers, Earth’s structure is part of a broader system that includes:
                Geosphere: The solid Earth, including all rock layers.
                Hydrosphere: All water, liquid and frozen.
                Atmosphere: The envelope of gases.
                Cryosphere: Ice and snow.
                Biosphere: All living organisms.
                These spheres interact continuously, shaping Earth’s surface, climate, and the conditions for life.
                7. Why Does Earth’s Structure Matter?
                Plate Tectonics: The movement of lithospheric plates causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the
                formation of mountain ranges.
                Magnetic Field: The geodynamo in the outer core generates a magnetic field, which shields the planet
                from solar wind and cosmic rays.
                Resource Distribution: The crust contains minerals, metals, and fossil fuels essential for human
                civilization.
                Planetary Evolution: Understanding Earth’s structure helps explain the history of our planet and the
                processes that shaped its surface and interior over billions of years.
