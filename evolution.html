             <div id="child2"><h2>Formation of the Earth</h2>
                 <p>Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, a rotating disk of gas and dust left over from the formation of the Sun.
                  Through a process called accretion, particles collided and stuck together, gradually building up the planet’s mass. This early Earth was a molten, 
                  hostile world, bombarded by asteroids and comets during a period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago). These 
                  impacts, along with intense volcanic activity, kept the surface molten and prevented the formation of a stable crust.
                  During this Hadean Eon (4.6–4.0 billion years ago), Earth’s interior began to differentiate: denser materials like iron and nickel sank to form the
                   core, while lighter silicates rose to form the mantle and, eventually, a thin crust. Volcanic outgassing released water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, and ammonia, creating a primitive atmosphere devoid of free oxygen. As the planet cooled, water vapor condensed into rain, filling depressions to form the earliest oceans.

                 <p id="para">The earliest evidence of life—microbial mat fossils and biogenic graphite—dates to between 3.7 and 3.5 billion
                     years ago, during the Archean Eon (4.0–2.5 billion years ago). These first organisms were single-celled prokaryotes
                      (bacteria and archaea), thriving in the oceans where they were shielded from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
                        A pivotal event was the evolution of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria around 2.7 billion years ago. These organisms
                         began producing oxygen as a byproduct, gradually transforming the atmosphere. Initially, oxygen reacted with iron in 
                         the oceans, forming banded iron formations. By about 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere—a 
                         phenomenon known as the Great Oxygenation Event—which was toxic to many anaerobic organisms but paved the way for more complex life.
                            During the Proterozoic Eon (2.5 billion–541 million years ago), oxygen levels continued to rise, enabling the evolution of eukaryotic cells (with a nucleus) around 
                          1.8 billion years ago. By 1 billion years ago, multicellular organisms had appeared, setting the stage for an explosion of biodiversity.

             <div id="child2"><h2>Geological and Climatic Transformation</h2>
                 <p>Earth’s surface has been reshaped continuously by plate tectonics, the movement of the planet’s lithospheric plates. The cycle of supercontinent formation and breakup—most recently Pangaea—has driven mountain building, volcanic activity, and changes in sea level and climate. For example, the Snowball Earth glaciations of the Neoproterozoic (1,000–539 million years ago) may have covered the planet in ice, profoundly affecting the course of evolution.
                    The atmosphere evolved from a toxic, oxygen-poor mix to the nitrogen-oxygen-rich air we breathe today, thanks to billions of years of biological and geological activity. The hydrosphere (oceans, lakes, rivers) has also changed, from hot, acidic seas to the diverse, life-sustaining bodies of water we know today.

                The evolution of Earth is a complex, dynamic saga of physical, chemical, and biological transformation. From a molten, inhospitable world to a vibrant, life-filled planet, Earth’s journey is unique in the known universe. Understanding this history not only illuminates our origins but also informs our responsibility as stewards of a world shaped by nearly five billion years of change.
